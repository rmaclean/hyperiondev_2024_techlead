# Leading a software development team presentation

This is the first time I've ever been asked for a presentation as part of a submission. I am not sure what form it should take, as the instructions implied a deck but that would not (atleast from the style of presentation I believe in) work, but I have included a PowerPoint with notes on each slide, though it may be easier to look at the PDF version for that.

I did include me presenting it in the video, which is superior in all aspects.

I would also HIGHLY recommend previous work I have done in this space as worthwhile additional material:
